# ClassShelf

ClassShelf is a collaborative web application that helps teachers manage their classroom libraries with a digital checkout system. The goal is to streamline book lending, reduce manual tracking, and give educators simple tools to keep their shelves organized.

## Features

- Check books in and out to individual students
- Search and autofill book data using public APIs (OpenLibrary, Google Books)
- Manually upload books that are missing from those databases
- View and manage a personal classroom collection
- Teacher login and secure access to individual accounts

## Why This Matters

Teachers often rely on paper logs or memory to track who has borrowed which books. ClassShelf provides a centralized, user-friendly solution that helps preserve classroom materials and encourages student accountability.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (styling framework is flexible based on team preference)
- Backend: Node and Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- APIs: OpenLibrary, Google Books
- Authentication: JWT-based login system

## Current Status

This project is in early development. We are actively building features, finalizing structure, and welcoming contributors.

## Project Structure

Our GitHub Projects board is organized with the following columns:

- Backlog
- Planning / Specs
- To Do
- In Progress
- Needs Review / Testing
- Completed

Each feature or fix should be tied to a GitHub Issue and linked to the board.

## Get Involved

We are looking for collaborators who are interested in:

- Frontend development (React or similar)
- Backend APIs and database management
- UX design tailored to teacher workflows
- Feature planning and testing

Whether you are new to web development or experienced, you are welcome to contribute. Feel free to check out the issues or message to get started.

## License

This project is open source. A license file will be added once the project structure is finalized.
