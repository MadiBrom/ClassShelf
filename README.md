# ClassShelf

ClassShelf is a collaborative web application that helps teachers manage their classroom libraries with a digital checkout system. The goal is to streamline book lending, reduce manual tracking, and give educators simple tools to keep their shelves organized.

## Features

- Check books in and out to individual students
- Search and autofill book data using public APIs (OpenLibrary, Google Books)
- Manually upload books that are missing from those databases
- View and manage a personal classroom collection
- Teacher login and secure access to individual accounts

## Why This Matters

Teachers often rely on paper logs or memory to track who has borrowed which books. ClassShelf provides a centralized, user-friendly solution that helps preserve classroom materials and encourages student accountability.

## Tech Used

- Frontend: React (styling framework is flexible based on team preference)
- Backend: Node and Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- APIs: OpenLibrary, Google Books
- Authentication: JWT-based login system


## License
